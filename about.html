              <h2>Creating the Restaurant</h2>
              <p>During a dinner in a Korean barbeque restaurant, founder Jeff Businessman came up with an amazing idea. What if, there was a korean barbeque style restaurant for American food? Now the question is what food he wanted to target. Originally, it was deep frying. A place where people can dine in and coat and deep fry their own food. However, after an accident which lead to one of his friends burning their arm using a deep fryer for testing, Mr Businessman needed to shut down the idea.</p>
              <p>All was not lost though. Two months later while eating in the same Korean barbeque restaurant, Jeff had another epiphany, what if there was a restaurant where people could grill their own food. Thus COOKIN was born. First opening up in 2021 and going strong with a large following.</p>

        <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
        <p>COOKIN is inspired by Korean and Japanese barbeque restaurants. The idea of having the customers cook their own food is such an amazing idea that we are suprised no American place has done this before. Not only does this make a new novel American experience, it also brings in that feeling of eating barbeque with your faimly or friends during the summer time. This is the experience we want to replicate in COOKIN. Our meats and products are well prepared, saving the effort of prep and marinatiing the meats. We take you to the fun step, the cooking. </p>
